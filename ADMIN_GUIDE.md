## Database Tables

Your Supabase has these tables:
- `categories` - AI tool categories (Writing, Image, Video, etc.)
- `ai_tools` - Main tools database
- `ai_news` - News articles
- `tool_reviews` - User reviews
- `tool_submissions` - User-submitted tools
- `site_analytics` - Visit tracking
- `admin_users` - Admin credentials (not currently used)

## Security

- Admin panel uses client-side password protection
- Database uses Row Level Security (RLS)
- All data operations go through Supabase
- Environment variables stored in `.env`

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Changes don't appear on website
- **Solution:** Check the tool/news status is "Published"
- **Solution:** Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache and refresh

**Problem:** Can't login to admin panel
- **Solution:** Password is `20102010` (eight digits)
- **Solution:** Clear browser session storage

**Problem:** Can't save changes
- **Solution:** Check Supabase connection in `.env`
- **Solution:** Check RLS policies allow writes

## Next Steps

To make this production-ready:
1. Change admin password in `/src/lib/auth.ts`
2. Consider implementing proper Supabase Auth
3. Add user roles and permissions
4. Set up backup automation
